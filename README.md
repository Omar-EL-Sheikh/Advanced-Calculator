  dividing.
  2. Complex: Does basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers like adding and 
  multiplying.
  3. Equations: The mode can solve three different types of equations Two Equations in 
  Two Unknowns, Three Equations in Three Unknowns, and Quadratic Equation.
  4. Matrix: The mode can execute operations like adding, multiplying, transposing, and 
  inversing on matrices.
  5. Vector: Executes dot and cross multiplying on vectors.
  6. Table: Generates a table of values from a given polynomial equation and a range of 
inputs.
